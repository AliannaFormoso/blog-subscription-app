## ✍ Instructions

- #### Front-end

     1. Create a form, with fields 'first name, last name, email, user name, and password'.
     2. This form should be connected to a DB that must be updated with each record inserted from the form.
     3. Make the validations from html. All fields must be properly filled out before sending them to the DB.
     4. The Password field must be between 4-8 characters long.
     5. Show connection states.
     6. If data is properly filled it will be created a record in the DB, otherwise the user must be notified by a clear message on the problem or error and then go to the form again.

- #### Database

    1. Create a database with a table and needed fields to keep and save the information.

- #### Back-end

    1. Make validations from the back-end too. If data is properly filled it will be created a record in the DB, otherwise the user must be notified by a clear message on the problem or error and then go to the form again.
    2. If the email is already in use in the DB, the user must be notified and then go to the form again.
    3. If everything is ok, a message will be shown on the screen to let the user know. All data will be saved in the DB.
    4. Show a button to see all the data records.
